MUSDEWAR is the acronym of an Individual Marie Skłodowska Curie Fellowhip conducted by musicologist/researcher Dr Anna Papaeti from 1 December 2017 to 30 November 2019 (Horizon 2020) at the Department of Social Anthropology at Panteion University, Athens. Scientist in charge was Professor Athena Athanasiou. The project explored the use of music in situations of detention in (post) civil-war Greece (1947–1957). It critically examined: (1) the use of music as a means to punish, humiliate, terrorize, and ‘re-educate’ prisoners; (2) the complex issue of performance under command, examining official camp orchestras and choirs at the notorious prison camps at the barren island of Makronissos, among others; (3) the role of the  Makronissos Radio Station of Military Forces, one of the first to be established in Greece in 1949; (4) music compositions, (clandestine) performances, and debates on Greek music – such as the rebetiko – by prisoners themselves. Analysing these aspects combined historical and empirical research with a critical and theoretical framework. The project showed explored the entanglement in the use of music in this context: on the one hand, it was an integral part of terror and repression mechanisms, on the other, it had the potential to empower prisoners/detainees. It documented and reconstructed the use of music and musical life in detention through archival and textual research, and interviews with former detainees, composers and intellectuals of the tim.
